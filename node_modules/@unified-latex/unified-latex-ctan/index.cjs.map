If multiple packages\n * export a macro with the same name, then the later-exported one takes precedence. If two packages\n * export a macro/environment of the same name but with conflicting argument signatures, this can\n * cause issues when another unified-latex package processes arguments positionally. For example,\n * by default `\\textbf` takes one argument, but the beamer version of `\\textbf` takes two arguments.\n * During HTML conversion, if arguments are referenced positionally, this may cause previously-working\n * code to fail with when beamer macro signatures are used. A workaround is provided: `_renderInfo.namedArguments`.\n * If `_renderInfo.namedArguments` is specified on both the original macro/environment definition\n * **and** the conflicting one, other unified-latex commands can reference arguments by name instead\n * of by position.\n */\n"],"names":["amsart.macros","cleveref.macros","exam.macros","geometry.macros","hyperref.macros","latex2e.macros","listings.macros","makeidx.macros","mathtools.macros","minted.macros","nicematrix.macros","systeme.macros","tikz.macros","xcolor.macros","xparse.macros","beamer.macros","multicol.macros","amsart.environments","cleveref.environments","exam.environments","geometry.environments","hyperref.environments","latex2e.environments","listings.environments","makeidx.environments","mathtools.environments","minted.environments","nicematrix.environments","systeme.environments","tikz.environments","xcolor.environments","xparse.environments","beamer.environments","multicol.environments"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAsBO,MAAM,YAAY;AAAA,EACrB,QAAQA,MAAO;AAAA,EACf,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,MAAMC,SAAK;AAAA,EACX,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,SAASC,WAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,UAAUC,WAAS;AAAA,EACnB,SAASC,QAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,WAAWC,QAAU;AAAA,EACrB,QAAQC,WAAO;AAAA,EACf,YAAYC,QAAW;AAAA,EACvB,SAASC,WAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,MAAMC,OAAK;AAAA,EACX,QAAQC,OAAO;AAAA,EACf,QAAQC,QAAO;AAAA,EACf,QAAQC,QAAO;AAAA,EACf,UAAUC,QAAS;AACvB;AAMO,MAAM,kBAAkB;AAAA,EAC3B,QAAQC,MAAO;AAAA,EACf,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,MAAMC,SAAK;AAAA,EACX,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,UAAUC,QAAS;AAAA,EACnB,SAASC,WAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,UAAUC,WAAS;AAAA,EACnB,SAASC,QAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,WAAWC,QAAU;AAAA,EACrB,QAAQC,WAAO;AAAA,EACf,YAAYC,QAAW;AAAA,EACvB,SAASC,WAAQ;AAAA,EACjB,MAAMC,OAAK;AAAA,EACX,QAAQC,OAAO;AAAA,EACf,QAAQC,QAAO;AAAA,EACf,QAAQC,QAAO;AAAA,EACf,UAAUC,QAAS;AACvB;;;"}
